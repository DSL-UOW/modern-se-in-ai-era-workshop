            <p>
              Software engineering (SE) is moving toward a future in which a development team may consist of only a few
              human developers, supported by tens or even hundreds of autonomous AI agents that design, build, test, and
              continuously evolve software at machine speed. This workshop explores how rapidly we are approaching this
              reality and what it means for the foundations of software engineering. It features talks from leading
              software engineering researchers from the University of Sydney, Monash University, Macquarie University,
              CSIRO Data61, and the University of Wollongong, and challenges participants to rethink core SE practices
              (requirements, design, testing, maintenance, and accountability) when AI becomes an active collaborator
              rather than a tool. The workshop also serves as a catalyst for collaboration, providing a forum to share
              recent work, explore joint research directions and define concrete initiatives such as collaborative grant
              proposals, co-authored publications and related activities.

                <p><b>Presenter:</b> A/Prof. Xi Zheng</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                  <b>Abstract:</b> Learning-enabled autonomous systems—such as self-driving vehicles and intelligent
                  drones—pose
                  unprecedented challenges for safety assurance due to the opaque and unpredictable nature of deep
                  neural networks. This talk introduces NeuroStrata, a new neurosymbolic architecture for autonomous
                  systems, which marks a paradigm shift from black-box learning to interpretable, reasoning-based
                  intelligence. By integrating neural perception with symbolic reasoning, NeuroStrata enables
                  certifiable AI, bridging the gap between data-driven adaptability and formal verifiability. This
                  vision is now being realized through a neurosymbolic perception module deployed in collaboration with
                  an Australian drone company, demonstrating real-world feasibility for safety-critical applications.

                <p><b>Presenter:</b> Dr. Xiao Cheng</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Abstract:</b> Program analysis is fundamental to software quality
                  assurance, as it enables automated reasoning about program behavior and the verification of properties
                  against specifications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise for program analysis due
                  to their strong capability for semantic understanding, acquired through extensive training on
                  large-scale codebases. However, because of the hallucination tendency of LLMs, they may produce
                  spurious or counterfactual outputs, hurting the accuracy of program behavior reasoning. This problem
                  becomes significantly more serious when applying LLMs to whole-program analysis, where the target is
                  not toy, function-level code but industrial-scale codebases consisting of millions of lines of code.
                  These limitations hinder the practical adoption of LLM-powered program analysis.</p>

                <p>In this talk, I will present three works on LLM-powered whole-program analysis and its key
                  applications: library API specification generation (ICSE 2026), fuzz driver enhancement (NDSS 2026),
                  and codebase-level program repair (FSE 2026). I will elaborate on our methodologies for effectively
                  combining LLMs with fundamental program analysis techniques and for mitigating hallucinations in
                  LLM-powered whole-program analysis through program decomposition, verification, and
                  retrieval-augmented generation techniques.</p>

                <p><b>Presenter:</b> Dr. Yongqiang Tian</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Abstract:</b> The field of compiler engineering has long relied on deep
                  human expertise and painstaking manual effort for tasks like finding subtle bugs or optimizing
                  performance. This labour-intensive process, however, fundamentally limits the pace of development and
                  analysis. This talk presents our recent work on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can fundamentally
                  supercharge this process, allowing engineers to operate with unprecedented speed and efficiency. We
                  will demonstrate how LLMs can intelligently (1) generate candidates for missed peephole optimizations
                  and (2) implement language-specific transformations to automate the debugging workflow. </p>
